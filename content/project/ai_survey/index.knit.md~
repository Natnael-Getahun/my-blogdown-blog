## 🎬 How It All Started  

We’re a group of Statistics students who got curious: **how much do our classmates really lean on AI tools like ChatGPT?**  
We decided to find out, so we built a survey, crunched some numbers, and wrote up the results. The data are eye‑opening, the trends are real, and (as we’ll happily admit) the sampling isn’t perfect.

## 🧪 Our Not‑So‑Perfect Method  

- **Target population:** undergrads in four CNCS departments (CompSci, Biology, Statistics, Math).  
- **Intended sampling:** Probability Proportional to Size stratified by department.  
- **Reality check:** we couldn’t get full student lists in time. We shared a Google Form in lectures and Telegram groups—so convenience bias crept in.  
- **Final N:** 142 usable responses, mostly 2nd to 4th years.

## 🔥 What We Found  

| 🔍 Insight | 💭 Our Take |
|-----------|------------|
| **ChatGPT rules** (93 % used last month). | It’s free, fast, and always awake. |
| **AI = study buddy.** Assignments & revision top the usage list. | Goodbye textbooks, hello prompts. |
| **Seniority ⇒ more AI.** 4th‑years lead in heavy use. | Burn‑out or next‑level efficiency? You decide. |
| **Math majors resist.** Not one declared “always use AI.” | Respect! |
| **Ethical worries? Meh.** 59 % reject the “unethical” label. | AI already feels like standard kit. |
