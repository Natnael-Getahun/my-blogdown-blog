  I faced an unusual problem in the middle of [The Impostors League](/project/pes_tournament/)
  project I was working on. The whole project was about using data visualization in
  a mini game tournament we had organized in our dorm.
  Initially, I considered using Power BI or Tableau, but both required extra
  setup for my friends to access my visualizations. That‚Äôs when I discovered Google‚Äôs
  Looker Studio‚Äîa simpler, more accessible alternative to Power BI. As
  long as my friends had a Google account, they could instantly access the
  dashboard.
  
  Here‚Äôs my experience with it‚Äîand what I learned along the way.

I‚Äôll start this post with a confession. It has been four months since I built the dashboard for [The Impostors League](/project/pes_tournament/) project. Spoiler alert: I haven‚Äôt opened Looker Studio since then. My memory is fuzzy, but hey‚Äîthat makes this post more fun to write. Think of it as a reflection, with extra sprinkles of chaos.

# What is Looker Studio?
Looker Studio is Google‚Äôs free, web-based data viz tool. Think of it as the chill, younger sibling of Power BI or Tableau... the one that doesn‚Äôt ask you to install anything or set up a whole environment.

It‚Äôs part of the Google Workspace ecosystem, so if you‚Äôre already living in Sheets and Docs (guilty), it fits right in.

## Importing Data
Getting your data in is easy, especially from Google Sheets. You just hit `ADD DATA`, point to your spreadsheet, and boom... you‚Äôre in.

Besides Sheets, it can also pull from BigQuery, Google Analytics, Excel, MySQL, Looker, and some other fancy sources I didn‚Äôt touch (because dorm Wi-Fi is a thing).

## Adding Charts
Building the charts? Honestly, kind of fun. You grab a table, drag it onto your canvas, customize a few fields, then pick out the pie chart. 

If you‚Äôve ever touched Tableau or Power BI, Looker Studio will feel familiar. I watched one YouTube video (linked below) and that was all I needed:

# My Experience
It took me around four hours to build three dashboards for our PES tournament.

One dashboard showed tables and results. Another tracked attacking stats. And the third? Defensive resilience... we all needed proof that Philimon wasn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúunlucky,‚Äù just bad at defense. üòÑ

The process itself felt smooth. I could open Looker Studio in my browser, drag things around, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîshare it with my friends via link. No logins, no app installs, no ‚Äúwait, how do I open this file?‚Äù

But not everything was sunshine. Some calculations had to be done in Google Sheets first because Looker Studio‚Äôs formulas are... let's just say *humble*. And a couple of charts acted moody‚Äîthey‚Äôd vanish until I refreshed the page like five times.

That said, the whole thing was fun. I wasn‚Äôt stressing about perfect layouts or advanced filters. I was just telling a story with data, and Looker Studio made that surprisingly easy.

## Pros
- **No Setup Drama**: Just open it in your browser and start.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed a PhD to get things moving.
- **Seamless with Google Sheets**: I had already planned to collect the data in Sheets, so this was perfect.
- **Instant Sharing**: Sharing a link was enough for my friends to jump in.
- **Live Updates**: Edits in Sheets reflected instantly on the dashboard (after you manually told it to update).
- **It‚Äôs Free**: Can‚Äôt beat free, especially on a student budget.

## Cons
- **Limited Customization**: Want custom fonts, layouts, or fancy animations? Nope.
- **Chart Selection is Basic**: You get the essentials‚Äîbar, pie, table‚Äîbut nothing spicy like violin plots.
- **Buggy on Slow Wi-Fi**: Sometimes charts didn't show up unless we refreshed the page.
- **Math is Better in Sheets**: For anything slightly complex, I had to go back to Google Sheets.
- **Mobile View is Mid**: On phones, scrolling was weird and layouts broke like LEGO bricks.

# Lessons Learned
- Start with a clean sheet (pun intended)‚Äîgood headers, no merged cells, no chaos.
- Do your heavy lifting (a.k.a. simple feature engineering) in Google Sheets first.
- Keep things simple. This isn‚Äôt Tableau, and that‚Äôs fine.

# Will I Use Looker Studio Again?
Mostly, no.

Why did I feel like that was harsh?

Maybe... if the situation is casual and I need something quick and collaborative.

But if I‚Äôm presenting in class, applying for internships, or trying to impress someone with fancy slicers‚ÄîPower BI or Tableau are still the go-tos.

Still, I‚Äôd totally recommend Looker Studio to any student, beginner, or anyone who wants to dip their toes into data viz without drowning.
