  About four months ago, my friends and I had the idea to start a gaming 
  tournament among ourselves. Our favorite game was a 2024-modded version of Pro 
  Evolution Soccer 2017 (PES 2017). Right away, I knew I wanted to build an 
  interactive dashboard to visualize our gaming stats.
  
  Initially, I considered using Power BI or Tableau, but both required extra 
  setup for my friends to view the data. That’s when I discovered Google’s 
  Looker Studio—a simpler, more accessible alternative to Power BI. Best of all, 
  it connects easily with Google Sheets, making it perfect for our needs. As 
  long as my friends had a Google account, they could instantly access the 
  dashboard.
  
  Here’s how I built it—and what I learned along the way.
