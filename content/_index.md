description: Sit down, relax, and get to know me through my works. With interests in data analysis, machine learning applications, and the up-and-coming Ethiopian capital market, you can find my projects, their details, and my opinions on random stuff here. I created this blog with more inspiration thatn getting my work out there, but I also hope one day in the near future someone like me ill find this site, and at least get some picture of where they want to go.
