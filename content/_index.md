description: Grab a seat, take a breath, and explore my world through the work I’ve done. With a passion for decision-driven analysis, machine learning, and the rising Ethiopian capital market, this blog is where I unpack my projects, share the thinking behind them, and sometimes just talk about whatever’s on my mind. This space isn’t just a portfolio—it's a journal of curiosity, exploration, and intent. Sure, it’s about putting my work out there, but more importantly, it’s for anyone—especially someone like me—who’s trying to figure out where they want to go, and how to get there.
