  Hey there — I’m Natnael Getahun, a third-year Statistics student at Addis Ababa University who’s obsessed with numbers, data, and all the stories they can tell.

\nI started as a young boy who obsessed over math problems he couldn't solve. I continued to Statistics in the hopes of finding real world application of mathematics. Along the way, I discovered two worlds that completely changed the game for me: artificial intelligence and finance. Now, I spend a good chunk of my time exploring how data can be used to make smart predictions — stock prices, market trends, economic shifts, you name it. There’s something deeply satisfying (and yeah, a little bit like having a superpower) about using raw numbers to anticipate what’s coming.

\nI’ve been deep in the weeds with personal and academic projects that bring math, code, and markets together. From building financial forecasting models to experimenting with machine learning, I treat every project as a chance to learn something new — and hopefully build something useful.

\nThis site is where I share what I’ve been working on, thinking about, or sometimes just what’s been keeping me up at night. I’m especially interested in short-term trend prediction, making data-driven investing more accessible, and using AI in ways that go beyond buzzwords.

\nIf you're working on something cool in data science, finance, or AI, let’s talk.

\nThanks for stopping by!"
